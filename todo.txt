MACHINE LEARNING TODO 
	⁃	Deal with y_raw nonsense
	⁃	We need to preprocess without taking the test set into account and check that we are doing it per feature
	⁃	Perhaps we need to make the inputs have different forms 
	⁃	Clean up the code
	⁃	Finish Part 2

Steps to finishing Part 2:
	⁃	Add data to report performance on the initial architecture used + why
	⁃	Complete the evaluate_architecture function with all of the evaluation metrics —> Find out how sticky learn can be used for this
	⁃	Fine tune all of the parameters and save data + generate graphs from it —> Figure out how touse stick learn
	⁃	Save the best performing model with pickle file ??
	⁃	Test on LabTS
	⁃	Write Report


Figure out if it works on LabTS machine

ASIDE

	⁃	Take a look at preprocessing problem
